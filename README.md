# Ignisat - An AI-Powered IoT CubeSat for Urban Heat Island (UHI) Mitigation

## Introduction to Urban Heat Island (UHI)

**Urban Heat Island (UHI)** refers to the phenomenon where urban areas exhibit higher temperatures than their surrounding rural regions due to anthropogenic activities. This temperature disparity arises from heat-absorbing surfaces (like asphalt and concrete), reduced vegetation, and localized climate imbalances.

### Consequences of UHI:

- **Energy Strain**: Increased demand for cooling in urban centers leads to higher energy consumption, straining power grids and raising operational costs.  
- **Health Risks**: Elevated temperatures amplify air pollution, exacerbate heat-related illnesses, and disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.  
- **Water Resource Depletion**: UHI intensifies water demand, depleting supply and impacting water quality.  
- **Biodiversity Disruption**: Urban heat creates inhospitable environments for local flora and fauna, disrupting ecosystems and reducing biodiversity.
